      "about": "There’s no better example of American ingenuity than American motor racing. A mix of cleverness and passion drives the idea to build something into what it’s not and send it around the racetrack as quickly as physics allow. Who would have thought that racing full-sized family cars would turn into one of our national pastimes? It wasn’t built to be, but that’s why it is such a spectacle.But even though modern-day racing has evolved into contests for highly sophisticated and specialized machinery, Americans still nurture a grassroots passion for racing just about anything. Case in point: The Harley-Davidson Screamin’ Eagle Road Glide factory racebike."

The weather was hot, but the bad kind of hot, close and muggy, extremely so by the western-facing Pacific beaches. And the bike was a beautiful sight, but it was clumsy in slow-speed traffic and ill-suited to the daylong routes our guides had chosen for us. “Berlin Built,” which had felt right to me when I rode the R 18 around Malibu last year, felt all wrong. As one of our group said, “It’s like the upper half of your body is on one motorcycle and the lower half of your body is on another.” "

      "about": "Practicality, in the truest sense of the word, is hard to come by in motorcycling these days. The specialization of the marketplace has divided the showroom floor by making bikes so sharply focused that versatility has been developed out of the equation. Bikes have primarily been designed on a performance, styling, or even lifestyle basis, and for a new rider, that narrowness of focus can make choosing a motorcycle confusing and often intimidating. So instead of the usual motorcycle powerplant, which is designed for high power density and rpm, the NC750X parallel-twin engine’s forte is excellent efficiency at lower revs, as demonstrated by its comparatively low 6,500-rpm redline.

      "about": "The engine design also allowed Honda to tilt the cylinders forward at a 55-degree angle, which provides numerous benefits: It permits a fairly low 31.6-inch seat height, which fosters confidence in new riders (and the seat feels much lower than that due to a shape that narrows at the front); it allows for a cavernous 23-liter ignition-keyed storage space, big enough for a full-face helmet or a decent load of groceries, where the fuel tank normally sits; and the 3.8-gallon fuel tank can be relocated below the rider’s seat, so the NC750X DCT’s center of mass is kept very low to aid handling.

      "about": "My first pickup, acquired when I was just 16, was a single-cab 1971 Chevy C10. It was old, it was loud, but it always ran, no matter what. My dad had kept it around for taking junk to the dump and hauling whatever was too dirty or smelly to be around his nice truck, so it had multiple colors of primer and paint; overall I’d say it was an orangish camo. Despite the looks, the smell of unburned hydrocarbons mixed with burned oil that stuck to you after driving it, and the general weirdness, I loved it. overall I’d say it was an orangish camo.

He also owns some unique customs, such as a 1971 Honda chopper built by “Yosemite” Sam Radoff.But this Indian 4 is by far a truly unique custom. Hayward, who founded the Traveling Black History Museum, felt like doing something new. And in his mind, that meant stuffing a battery powertrain into his Indian 4. The bike, built by “some friends and secret wizardry,” has earned the nickname “The Endian.” "

      "about": "Some would explain these differences by saying that the larger the bore, the longer it takes for the flame to cover the distance from the spark plug to the cylinder wall. But flame speed is not a constant: The vigor of the fuel-air charge turbulence in the cylinder is the determining factor. When a correct fuel/air mixture is perfectly still, the flame speed is inches per second—too slow for any useful engine. What actually spreads the flame is turbulence in the cylinder—energy left over from the high-speed intake process—and the greater the turbulence, the faster the flame travel. "
